The goal of this set of projects is to have a reusable (open standard) way to define the mapping from modbus registers into usable values, and be able to generate running software that does this mapping in various languages.
The overall effect is that for a device this schema only needs to be defined once and for a specific programming language the mapping only needs to be defined once.
