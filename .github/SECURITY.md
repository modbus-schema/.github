# Security Policy

The Modbus Schema team takes security very seriously, and aim to resolve issues as quickly as possible. Building secure
software is a continuous process, and can always be improved. As such we welcome reports on potential security 
vulnerabilities, as well as suggestions around hardening the software and our process.

## Reporting a suspected vulnerability

It is important that suspected vulnerabilities are disclosed in a responsible way, and are not publicly disclosed until
after they have been analysed and a fix is available.

To report a security vulnerability, send an email to modbus-security@basjes.nl .

Do *not* open a public issue, send a pull request, or disclose any information about the suspected vulnerability publicly.
If you discover any publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities, please notify us *immediately* through
modbus-security@basjes.nl .

## Automatic updates

We strongly recommend using tool like [Renovate](https://renovatebot.com) or [Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot) to get the latest versions of all your dependencies automatically as a pull request in Github or Gitlab.
